## Project Objective  
To review **banking transactions** across current and savings accounts in Nigeria (**2024**), with a focus on chargebacks, debit/credit anomalies, and suspicious transaction timing, in order to uncover fraud risk and possible system control weaknesses.  

**Focus Areas:**  
- Identifying accounts with multi-location activity and high chargeback rates.  
- Analyzing chargeback hotspots by city.  
- Reviewing unusual fees and reimbursements (possible insider fraud).

## Key Insights (Highlights)

- High-risk cities due to chargebacks as a result of fraud and unauthorized transactions: **Ibadan, Makurdi, Kaduna, Kano, Owerri, Onitsha**.  
- **Debit transactions (62.5% of total transactions)** dominates, with FX purchases concentrated in **Owerri, Kano, Ibadan**.  
- **Account Maintenance Fee deductions** up to ₦492k suggest fraud or system gaps.
